# Salvum_Prebuilt_Native
This is the package deployed for Appalachian State University to support interactive cybersecurity education.

Native Ubuntu 20 LTS installer. For cross-platform Salvum, see containerized versions.

Yara and PXE functionality have been yanked out of this distribution along with the QVLx FCC db.

This made the image way smaller and easier to work with. Servf should also not work as its been commented.

In conclusion, this installable package is smaller than the full 300+ app version by design.
